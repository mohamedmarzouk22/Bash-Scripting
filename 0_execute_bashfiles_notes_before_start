1)- How to execute the bash files ?

- You can use the command bash for any bash file with any permission even if it is not executable such as 
$ bash 1_Hello_world.sh
- You can execute the file directly by relative path but it should be executable file to do so 
$ ./1_Hello_world.sh


2) the heading of each file in this tutorials: 

You need to specify the path to the Bash or other programming 
language executable that you intend to use for writing your script.

Previously were 
#!/bin/bash

But now
#!/opt/homebrew/Cellar/bash/5.2.26/bin/bash

# Why I changed the bash ? 
The default version of Bash on iMac is 3.2, which may have limitations and 
compatibility issues with certain functions. To overcome this, users can 
install a newer version using Homebrew, which resolves many of these issues. 
It's worth noting that Apple's focus has shifted towards Zsh, a licensed shell,
 which receives updates, unlike Bash, which remains at the older version due 
 to licensing constraints.
